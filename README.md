# 📊 Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment

## 🚀 Project Overview
Analyze and predict stock price movements using sentiment analysis of social media data, particularly from Telegram channels. This project integrates data scraping, sentiment analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning to provide insights into the relationship between public sentiment and stock performance.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **Data Scraping**: Extract relevant posts from Telegram channels using the `Telethon` library.
- 📈 **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) with libraries like `NLTK` and `TextBlob`.
- 🛠️ **Feature Engineering**: Combine sentiment data with stock price information for meaningful predictors.
- 📊 **Visualization**: Visualize trends in sentiment and their correlation with stock prices.
- 🤖 **Predictive Modeling**: Use regression-based models to predict stock price movements.

## 🧰 Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
```bash
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from telethon.sync import TelegramClient
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
from wordcloud import WordCloud
import yfinance as yf
```

## 📂 Project Structure
Setup: Import all necessary libraries.
Data Scraping: Extract Telegram channel messages using Telethon.
Sentiment Analysis: Apply NLTK or TextBlob to analyze sentiment.
Feature Engineering: Merge sentiment scores with stock price data.
Visualization: Create insightful plots to visualize trends.
Modeling: Build regression models to analyze the impact of sentiment on stock prices.
## 📝 Key Code Snippets
Telegram Data Scraping
python
Copy code
```bash
from telethon.sync import TelegramClient

api_id = 'your_api_id'
api_hash = 'your_api_hash'
client = TelegramClient('session_name', api_id, api_hash)
client.start()

messages = []
async for message in client.iter_messages('channel_name', limit=100):
    messages.append(message.text)
```
Sentiment Analysis
```bash
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
data['sentiment_score'] = data['message'].apply(lambda x:
sid.polarity_scores(x)['compound'])
```
Stock Price Data
```bash
import yfinance as yf

stock_data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2023-01-01', end='2023-12-31')
Visualization
python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.lineplot(data=merged_data, x='date', y='sentiment_score', label='Sentiment')
sns.lineplot(data=merged_data, x='date', y='Close', label='Stock Price')
plt.show()

```
Modeling
```bash
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
X = merged_data[['sentiment_score']]
y = merged_data['Close']
model.fit(X, y)
print("Model Coefficients:", model.coef_)
```
## 📊 Outputs
Word Cloud: Visualize frequent words in Telegram posts.
Sentiment Trends: Plots showing sentiment score changes over time.
Model Insights: Regression coefficients reflecting the sentiment-stock relationship.
## 🛠️ How to Use
Clone the repository.
Replace placeholders (api_id, api_hash, channel_name) with your own details.
Run the notebook cell by cell to reproduce the analysis.
Modify the stock symbol in the yfinance section to explore other stocks.
